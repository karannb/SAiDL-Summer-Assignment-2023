# Implemented tasks - 

## 1. Core ML task and it's bonus task.
## 2. Computer Vision task and it's bonus task.
## 3. Reinforcement Learning task.<br></br>

### I have considered all tasks to be comparative studies and thus I have not tried to train my models for very long periods to achieve a baseline performance (I confirmed with my mentor that it wasn't necessary either), but my models <u>can</u> achieve baseline performance if trained more, evident from the results I have got.<br></br>
### Detailed READMEs are in individual folders and all my models will be in the respective ```__pycache__``` folders.
